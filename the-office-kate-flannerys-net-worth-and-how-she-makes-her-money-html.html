Flannery was on&nbsp;The Office for a very long time, though fans might have seen her around on <a href=#>other TV shows</a> as well. It seems that Flannery has managed to have an interesting comedy career, so let’s take a look below to find out what her net worth is.</p><h2>Kate Flannery started her career in improv</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kate-Flannery.jpg><p id=par-2_26>Flannery was born on June 10, 1964, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Later on, she became one of the original members of&nbsp;Chicago’s Annoyance Theater.</p><p id=par-4_65>At the Annoyance Theater, Flannery performed in a feminist comedy show called “The Miss Vagina Pageant,” which caught the eye of a producer from&nbsp;<a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>. Flattery later <a href=#>recalled</a>: “Four of the six of us [in the play] were under consideration for SNL … I just remember it began to feel like a real pageant because we were vying for the next spot [on SNL].”</p><p id=par-5_24>Flannery ended up appearing on&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;for one episode in 2002. However, the highlight of her career would actually take place on another NBC hit show.</p><h2>Kate Flannery was on ‘The Office’ for nine seasons</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_39>The Office premiered in 2005 and quickly became extremely popular with viewers.

She once said in an <a href=#>interview</a>: “I am so proud of the ending of The Office. I felt that everything was wrapped up so nicely. It was sad and funny and thoughtful and everything you want in a finale… I am so sad, but I am so proud. It’s a great feeling to be a part of such a respected and honored project. A very rare thing in life.”</p><p id=par-9_86>In an essay for <a href=#>Huffington Post</a>, Flannery also expressed her gratefulness for&nbsp;The Office. She shared that she used to be “disappointed at first when my lines would get cut,” but after a while, she realized that she was blessed for being given a chance to be a part of such a wonderful show. Flannery thanked Greg Daniels,&nbsp;the developer of&nbsp;The Office, for “giving me this job, changing my life, putting me on the map, and making the back of my head almost as famous as the front.”</p><h2>Other shows and movies that Kate Flannery appeared on</h2><p id=par-10_53>Outside of&nbsp;The Office, Flannery acted in other funny shows and movies as well.
