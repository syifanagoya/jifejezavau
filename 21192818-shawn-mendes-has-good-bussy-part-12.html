He's an object of gentle ridicule for hiding in plain sight--for being so conspicuously gay yet still denial.

I know people want this artist coming out to be Shawn, I mean.. who wouldn't want him to come out? He has a new song coming out too, which makes the blind even more exciting. However, how likely is it really? IMO not much. He is bearding with Baldwin. Someone who is bearding won't come out two days later, this is bearding 101. Another guess is Harry Styles, which imo probably makes more sense. I read somewhere someone saying Harry was testing the waters with his last single, and that he will properly come out with his next, I think that makes a lot of sense, but I guess we'll see.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 196</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 22, 2018 9:22 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>R195, Demi is out and proud, and can’t respect a bearded closet case.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 197</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 22, 2018 9:22 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>[quote]You are bringing out a different kind of me There's no safety net that's underneath, I'm free Falling all in you Fell for men who weren't how they appear Trapped up on a tightrope now we're here, we're free Falling all in you</p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Offsite Link</a><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 198</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 22, 2018 9:24 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>I think Mendes will come out soon.</p><p>He obviously hates being closeted and doesn’t even attempt to be interested in these beards they’ve set him up with.</p><p>There’s no reason for a 19 year old to be closeted in 2018.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 201</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 22, 2018 9:26 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>[quote]Did you see his face as those shirtless male dancers walked out on stage?

His mouth is his most talent at this young age. I was very too big for fucking but he loves to be fucked. I think we spent 3 days together and then he had his manager pay me come to meet him for more nights in Las Vegas. That was more difficile because I had to be very discretion.

In addition, the photos were mostly devoid of cultural cues: hairstyles were digitally removed, and no faces had makeup, piercings, eyeglasses or tattoos.</p><p>With Shawn we have a lot more to go on, videos of his mannerisms, his reaction to shirtless male dancers etc. Then there are all the other cues, like blind items, him mentioning "all the rainbows" in a song, and the list goes on and on and on.

I remind very well the interview that they gave when they released their duo, it was awkward as hell. She is not into him and for sure he is not into her. Besties for sure but nothing more. And he is a songwriter because he writes his songs. You don't need to be Bob Dylar to be a songwriter, in fact your songs could be crap but you are a songwriter anyway. By the way, i don't think he is that bad. The problem with his songs is that he doesn't sound sincere. The whole knight in shiny armour of Treat you better sounds very very fake. But Mercy is a decent song, and it was interesting to chose Life of the party as debut song instead of something upbeat about dating girls wich was what everybody expects from a teen. His voice sounds good recorded, live he is not Sam Smith for sure but he can improve and there are a lot of pop star who are very bad live (Rihanna, Katy Perry). I think what make him so popular here (yes he is good looking but there are a lot of good looking singers and actors) is the fact that he is atypical. Generally there were two options for gay singers, be tortured, do drugs and all that jazz or embrace the fakeness and do pr relationships without hesitation and ejoying the fame (now fortunately there are a third option, coming out wich is not the death of a career anymore but has way more hurdles). But he is not doing anything of that, he doesn't seem tortured (the anxiety problems could be the fear of the performance, the pressure of keeping himself on the limelight so not necesarily related to himself as person) but he is very reluctant to bearding. He had three oportunities to let the story about Hailey to be all over the press but he came with the we are only friends really fast.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 444</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 27, 2018 11:35 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I think he’s a good singer</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 445</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 27, 2018 11:45 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>Are we just going to ignore the latina girl who has seen him out on dates?

And the answer "i'm too busy to date" seems that it doesn't work (even if it's true, in fact there's a BI about Thimothee Chalamet about his agents looking for a pr relationship for him just because they think he stayed single for too long).

In the meantime, he has to put up with questions about his dating life. Right now, he is all over the place, promoting his album.

And they sell way more albums than Shawn. Sam's first single went top 5 on billboard hot 100 on its first week, Shawn's didn't even top 20 (not a problem, almost all his hits needed some time to get into top 10). Sam Smith doesn't even need having a hit on the radio to sell albums. And the same for Ed Sheeran (his first album sold a lot with only a top 20 hit) Shawn won't be questioned all the time about his love life if his songs weren't about love. And he could easily avoid those questions. Maybe he can evolve into a singer marketable with an adult audience (there are a bunch of singers who have fans of all ages). He writes his songs and play instruments but it's difficult to know and the way they are handling his career (his first release it was a disaster and Stitches saved him from being the new Austin Mahone) can go either way, he can be the new Ed Sheeran (a cute version) or he can be totally irrelevant in five years</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 464</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 27, 2018 9:28 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Give him time, R464.
