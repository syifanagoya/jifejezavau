<time>12 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Tamra Judge put herself out of the Real Housewives of Orange County&nbsp;after twelve years. Tamra announced of her exit from the reality series, RHOC, through an Instagram post stating it was a time to move on after spending a 'wild' 12 years with RHOC. She further wrote she sees forward to her future.</span></p><p><span>Tamra, 52, joined the reality series in its third season back in November 2007 and was the highest paid-housewife (reportedly). Her quitting announcement from RHOC came after&nbsp;Vicki Gunvalson revealed of her departure before.</span></p><p><span>The 24th of January 2020 was Vicki's last moment in the Real Housewives of Orange County.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Tamra Was One Of The Highest-Paid&nbsp;Housewives; Her Net Worth Details</strong></span></h2><p><span>All About The Real Housewives&nbsp;reported that&nbsp;Tamra had a salary of $900,000 per season. She was the longest starring castmember of RHOC in its fourteenth season. However, Celebritynetworth mentioned that she garners $350,000 per season as&nbsp;a salary from RHOC,&nbsp;with a&nbsp;stunning <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> of $2 million.</span></p><p><span>She is also known for her work as a producer for&nbsp;Erasing Family,&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Orange County&nbsp;(2006), and&nbsp;Royal Pains&nbsp;(2009).</span></p><p><span>Apart from the entertainment industry, Tamra has her own space in professional life. She and her husband, Edward Judge (Eddie), own C.U.T Fitness company. Tamra's career history shows her work as a&nbsp;real estate agent for Ladera Realtor before joining RHOC in 2007.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span><strong>Tamra&nbsp;Judge Wedding&nbsp;With Edward Judge</strong></span></h2><p><span>Tamra Judge's romantic life might have been a tumultuous one; however, she never handled it her fate barehanded. She hooked up with three guys over the years, sharing a romantic bliss for several years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tamra, now, is in a long married life with her current husband, Edward Judge (Eddie). The ex-Real Housewives of Orange County star said 'i do' with Eddie on 15 June 2013 at St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort. Tamra donned in three different dresses designed by Mark Zunino, including the white floral gown as she walked down the aisle.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Similarly, she wore a $6,000 worth wedding shoes, diamond necklace, and silver drop earrings with diamonds as her son&nbsp;from a previous marriage,&nbsp;</span><span>Ryan served as the best man during the wedding ceremony.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/tamra-judge-wedding.jpg alt width=450 height=545 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><span>Tamra Judge sharing a passionate kiss with her husband, Eddie Judge during her wedding (©: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bravotv.com</a>)</span></p><p><span>Tamra and Edward kept their hands together on a $2500 worth lemon cake&nbsp;with a quilted pattern and edible diamonds. Similarly, the groom's cake (a bicycle cake) added the glitters to the moment, which also showcased Edward's passion for bicycling. Nevertheless, every decoration at St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort was a tribute to his&nbsp;cycling.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The beautiful couple hooked up in a marital tie after fifteen months of their engagement in March 2014. They were on a romantic voyage to Bora Bora, where Edward proposed her to be his life partner.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tamra and Edward Judge, now, relish a&nbsp;six and a half years of married life.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Tamra Was Married Twice Before; Kids Details</strong></span></h2><p><span>Before sharing her soul with Edward Judge, Tamra was married to the Real Housewives of Orange County costar, Simon Barney.</span></p><p><span>They remained husband and wife for thirteen years&nbsp;from 23 May 1998 to 2011, sharing three kids, namely,&nbsp;Sidney Barney (b.2000),&nbsp;Spencer Barney (b.2001), and&nbsp;Sophia Barney (b.2006).</span></p><p><span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/tamra-judge-ex-husband-simon.jpg alt width=450 height=503 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><span>Tamra Judge with her ex-husband, Simo Barney (©: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">usmagazine.com</a>)</span></p><p><span>Similarly, she was in five years of the marital tie with her former husband,&nbsp;Darren Vieth. She and Darren tied their nuptial knot on 11 May 1985, which lasted until 1990.</span></p><p><span>In the course of their half-decade of married life, Tamra and Darren welcomed a son named, Ryan Vieth, who served as the best man during Tamra's wedding with Edward Judge in 2015.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Tamra Judge Bio</strong></span></h2><p><span>Born as Tamra Sue Waddle in Glendale, California, in 1967,&nbsp;Tamra Judge celebrates her birthday on 2 September.
