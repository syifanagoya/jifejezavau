<time>01 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div></header><p>Most possibly in honor of TikTok's queen Charli D'Amelio making a landmark of a year into the video-syncing app, Forbes has released its first-ever list of 'Highest-Earning Stars' solely from the platform. But no one apparently expected Addison Rae to come out on top.
Although it is understandable that it could've happened, given Charli's additional following of over 20 million, no one really prepared for it as everyone remain shell-shocked. And the number is also something to wow at since until a couple of months ago, no one really thought these influencers earned millions from TikTok (reminder: TikTok doesn't pay them, they are just a medium).</p><footer><a href=../../how-addison-rae-earned-more-than-charli-tiktok.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../sounds-like-todd-mcfarlane-close-getting-financing-spawn-movie.html>Todd McFarlane Offers An Update On His Spawn Reboot</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
<time>30 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div></header><p>Todd McFarlane’s&nbsp;Spawn…Do You Believe?&nbsp;has got a very impressive cast, a cool-sounding script and some kickass crew members. But, as of right now, it doesn’t have any financing, perhaps because the concept for the movie is so different from traditional superhero fare.
Recommended Videos McFarlane’s plan is to treat Spawn like the shark in Jaws, a mostly off-screen presence constantly talked about but largely left to exist in the audience’s imaginations. A convenient side effect of this is that not having a hellfire-powered nightmare superhero on screen all the time saves on budget, which is why McFarlane hopes to convince studios that they should hand over the movie to him to direct as his debut feature.</p><footer><a href=../../sounds-like-todd-mcfarlane-close-getting-financing-spawn-movie.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../who-are-alex-murdaugh-parents-his-net-worth-and-wikipedia-bio.html>Who Are Alex Murdaugh Parents?
