She grew up in a football-loving family, as her father, Mark DelPercio, was the head coach of the Middletown High School football team. She attended the same school, where she met her future husband, Chris Godwin, who was a star player on the team.

They have been through many ups and downs, such as long-distance relationships, injuries, and career changes, but they have always stuck by each other and supported each other.

Godwin suffered the injury in the fourth quarter of the Buccaneers’ 31-24 win over the Atlanta Falcons last week, when he was tackled by Falcons cornerback Isaiah Oliver. Godwin did not return to the game, and an MRI revealed that he had a sprained MCL in his right knee.</p><p>Godwin’s injury is a big blow for the Buccaneers, who are currently tied with the New Orleans Saints and the Atlanta Falcons for the NFC South lead with a 6-7 record. Godwin has been having a breakout season, leading the team with 86 receptions, 1,333 yards, and nine touchdowns. He ranks second in the NFL in receiving yards, behind only Michael Thomas of the Saints. Godwin has been a reliable target for quarterback Jameis Winston, who has thrown for a league-high 4,115 yards and 26 touchdowns, but also a league-high 23 interceptions.</p><p>With Godwin out, the Buccaneers will have to rely on Mike Evans, who is also having a stellar season with 67 catches, 1,157 yards, and eight touchdowns. Evans is the only player in NFL history to start his career with six consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. However, Evans will likely face a tough matchup against Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander, who has been one of the best cover corners in the league this year. Alexander has allowed a passer rating of just 56.8 when targeted, and has two interceptions and 15 pass breakups.</p><p>The Buccaneers will also need someone to step up as the No. 2 receiver behind Evans. The most likely candidate is Trey Palmer, a rookie fifth-round pick out of Penn State. Palmer has played sparingly this season, appearing in only seven games and catching six passes for 81 yards. However, he showed some flashes of potential in the preseason, when he led the team with 13 receptions, 178 yards, and two touchdowns.</p><p>Palmer played with Godwin at Penn State, where they were both part of a prolific passing offense led by quarterback Trace McSorley. Palmer has a similar skill set to Godwin, as he is a fast and agile receiver who can run crisp routes and make tough catches in traffic.</p><p>Palmer will have a chance to prove himself against the Packers, who have a vulnerable secondary that ranks 23rd in the NFL in passing yards allowed per game (245.9) and 28th in touchdowns allowed (27). Palmer will likely line up against Packers cornerback Kevin King, who has struggled this season, allowing a passer rating of 104.9 when targeted, and giving up six touchdowns and only one interception.</p><p>The Buccaneers will need Palmer to provide a spark for their offense, as they face a crucial game against the Packers, who are 10-3 and have already clinched the NFC North title. The Packers have one of the best offenses in the league, led by quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who has thrown for 3,463 yards and 24 touchdowns, with only two interceptions.</p><p>The Packers also have a dynamic duo of running backs in Aaron Jones and Jamaal Williams, who have combined for 1,413 yards and 14 touchdowns on the ground. The Packers are averaging 23.8 points per game, while the Buccaneers are averaging 28.8 points per game.</p><p>The game between the Buccaneers and the Packers will be played on Sunday, December 17, at 1:00 p.m. ET at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The game will be broadcast on FOX. The Packers are favored by four points, according to DraftKings Sportsbook.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Net Worth</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>2023</td><td>$5 million</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>$3 million</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>$200,000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Mariah DelPercio is more than just Chris Godwin’s wife.
